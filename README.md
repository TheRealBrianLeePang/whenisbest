# When is Best, Version 1.0
_When is Best_ is a scheduling app designed to improve upon existing solutions.

We plan to integrate Google Calendar API into the sharing process to allow more efficient scheduling for group events.

Release versions will be 0.3, 0.7, and 1.0. Stay tuned for more!

# User Manual
First go to the login page and either log in if you already have an account or create an account.

Next you go to the create an event page.

From there, you can put in the name, whether the event reocurrs, the time increments for the event, and the duration of the event.

After that, you put in the start and end date, start and end time, and if it reoccurs, the frequency of recurrance. You will then be redirected to filling out your personal avaliablity. 

Upon completion, you will be emailed the link and be given the option to email the response link to others.

Once people have responded, you can then select the time with the most respondents and finalize the time of the event, which will send out an email to respondents to inform of confirmation.

After that, you have the event at the scheduled time(s)!
